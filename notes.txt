Basics:
    Goroutines
        Language Support for concurrency
            go, select, chan, range, channel operator ( <- )
        Builtin Scheduler

    Higher Order Functions
        Functions as data
            Functions can be assigned to variables
            Function can be passed as arguments to other functions
            Functions can be returned by other functions

    Implicit Implementation of Interfaces
    Memory Management

Goroutines
    1. 


for {
    select {
        case <- ch1:
            // do something
        case <- ch2:
            // do something
    }
}

Closures
    1. Outer Function
    2. Variable in the outer function
    3. Inner Function
    4. Variable in the outer function is referred (used) in the inner function
    5. Extend the lifetime of the inner function beyond the lifetime of the outer function
        (and thereby extending the lifetime of the variable)

Memoization
    Technique by which the application remembers the result of a function

Pure Function
    Referential Transparency
        The invocation of the function can be replaced by the result of the function without affecting the outcome

        What affects the outcome?
            side effects
